# Graphics-API-2D-OpenGL
This is a lightweight graphics drawing library using C++ and OpenGL. GLFW is used for making a window for the drawing and GLM is the math library. The core of the project is to create a 2D renderer for drawing 2D graphics. There is a file called renderer that has all the componants to the renderer including the vertex buffer, index buffer, shaders (GLSL), Textures, a windowing class, entities for drawing, and the actual renderer class that puts all of these componants together. There are multiple ways to draw things to the screen. There is a batch renerer that contains a vertex & index buffer to draw shapes and sprites in one draw call. These are the entites that all stem from the Entity class. There are also individual draw methods that the renderer class provides for drawing quads, circles, and custom verticies with a chosen OpenGL drawing primitive. These use their own draw calls. This API is capable of being used to make 2d games and other 2d graphics applications.
